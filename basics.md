# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit -m "put message here, describing activityd"` - commits the file in the repository
* `git diff` - compares the committed state to the non-added state
* `git log` - displays a list of activity with messages provided during commit
* push/pull to collaborators in Github
